### Background

For those who don't know, my full time job is to sit in front of a computer and write code. That means I spend a lot of time in and around the internet.

I've recently had some personal experience with the dark side of the internet and the people on it. That experience made me want to share some of the things I've learned about how to keep yourself safe in the digital era that we are all living in.

I intend for this to be a multi-part series on steps that _everyone_ can take to improve their online security. I want to help make sure that **you** are not the low hanging fruit for some bad actor thousands of miles away to take advantage of.

My primary audience for this post is my friends and family who don't necessarily sit down every morning and wonder about how safe they are online. I hope to both illustrate to you why it's important to think about these things, and provide some easy steps that you can take to help.
