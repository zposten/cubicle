My mom's omelets are famous where I come from, and for good reason. It was difficult getting her to give me measurements that didn't consist of "pinches" and "splashes" of things, but eventually I got pretty close.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient              | Amount                                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bacon                   | 1 lb                                                                 |
| Potatoes                | 2 small per omelet                                                   |
| Vegetable oil           | Most of a bottle                                                     |
| Eggs                    | 2 per omelet                                                         |
| Milk                    | 1/8 cup per omelet                                                   |
| Shredded cheddar cheese | Enough to coat the entirety of each omelet (will differ by pan size) |
| Salt and pepper         | To taste                                                             |
| Yellow onion (optional) | 1                                                                    |
| Sausage (optional)      | To taste                                                             |

## Prep

### Bacon

1. Cook bacon, save grease
1. Break up into small pieces

### Potatoes

1. Peel potatoes
1. Dice into small cubes (or you know, rectangular prisms).
1. Pour vegetable oil into a large frying pan until it's filled to a quarter of its depth.

   - Too much oil can cause it to overflow when potatoes are added because of the large amount of sizzle

1. Heat on high until potatoes sizzle when placed in.

   - Oil should be hot enough so that the outside gets crispy while the inside does not. The burner should be at least as high as 8/10.
   - Be very careful of splatter when pouring the potatoes into the hot oil. I would suggest using a spoon to drop them in a small amount at a time. Try not to splash the oil, it's _realllly_ hot.
   - If at any time grease starts to overflow the pan, immediately remove it from heat
   - It's sometimes easier to cook the potatoes in batches rather than all at once, to ensure that the pan doesn't overflow.

1. Let sit for two minutes (stir too early and the potatoes will turn to mush).
1. Stir until potato cuboids are golden brown.
1. Place the potatoes in a large bowl lined with paper towel to soak up grease

### Eggs

1. 2 eggs/omelet
1. Add a quarter cup of milk for every four eggs
1. Add about a shake of each salt and pepper per egg for flavoring
1. Whisk the mixture until it's a cohesive whole.

## Make It

1. Coat the bottom of the pan in bacon oil by tipping the pan around
1. Pour the eggs into the pan to fill the bottom in a quick fashion so part of it doesn't start to cook before the rest
1. Let the egg solidify while filling any holes
1. Add cheese over the entirety of the egg
1. Add the potatoes, bacon and optionally the onion and sausage on half of the egg circle
1. When the egg has some brown on the bottom, carefully flip the other half of egg over the ingredient half - It may be helpful to use two spatulas to do this.
