My mom's omelets are famous where I come from, and for good reason. It was difficult getting her to give me measurements that didn't consist of "pinches" and "splashes" of things, but eventually I got pretty close.

HOWEVER, over the years I have made several modifications to her original recipe, much to her annoyance. And it's for that reason that these are my "More Perfect than Mom's Omelets" <sub><i>(sorry mom)</i></sub>.

## Prep

### Bacon

| Ingredient | Amount |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Bacon      | 1 lb   |

1. Cook bacon
1. Break up into small pieces

You can either fry or bake the bacon, depending on your preference. Below are instructions for baking the bacon:

1. Meanwhile, get out another cookie sheet and cover it with tinfoil
1. <span>Place the uncooked strips of bacon on a [steel baking rack][amazon-baking-rack]</span>
   - If you don't have a baking rack...you should get one, it's wonderful
1. Put the rack on your tinfoil covered cookie sheet, and cook for 28 minutes, or until desired crispiness. But I'm telling you, 28 minutes is the sweet spot
1. Once cooked to perfection, break up the bacon into small pieces

### Potatoes

For the potatoes, you have the option of frying fresh potatoes or simply cooking and using frozen potatoes. I prefer the former because it makes the recipe soooo much simpler. But mom has always used the former.

#### For fresh potatoes

| Ingredient    | Amount          |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Potatoes      | 1 lb per omelet |
| Vegetable oil | {{variable}}    |

[Original Recipe](https://www.thebakingfairy.net/2015/08/the-perfect-stovetop-french-fries/)

1. Wash and peel your potatoes
1. Dice into medium cubes (or you know, rectangular prisms)
1. Place the fries into a cast iron skillet, making sure that they are in a single layer and not overlapping
1. Pour just enough vegetable oil over the potatoes to almost cover them completely
1. Turn heat onto medium-low and let the potatoes cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep them from sticking together
   - They're ready when they are golden brown and crisp on the outside
1. Remove the fries from the oil, and place on a paper towel to absorb excess oil
1. Toss with salt, pepper and any other desired seasonings

#### For frozen potatoes

| Ingredient      | Amount                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Frozen potatoes | Enough to cover half of the pan you're cooking the omelets in, for each omelet |

1. Read the bag

### Eggs

| Ingredient      | Amount             |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Eggs            | 2 per omelet       |
| Milk            | 1/8 cup per omelet |
| Salt and pepper | To taste           |

1. For each omelet, whisk together all ingredients in a small bowl

## Make It

| Ingredient              | Amount                                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shredded cheddar cheese | Enough to coat the entirety of each omelet (will differ by pan size) |
| Yellow onion (optional) | 1                                                                    |
| Sausage (optional)      | To taste                                                             |

1. Heat a small amount of olive oil (or optionally the siphoned bacon grease) over medium heat
1. Quickly pour the egg mixture into the pan to fill the bottom so that part of it doesn't start to cook before the rest
1. Let the egg solidify while filling any holes
1. Add cheese over the entirety of the egg
1. Add the remaining ingredients onto only half of the egg circle
1. When the egg has some brown on the bottom, carefully flip the other half of egg on top of the half with the ingredients - it may be easiest to use two spatulas
