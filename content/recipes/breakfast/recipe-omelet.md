My mom's omelets are famous where I come from, and for good reason. It was difficult getting her to give me measurements that didn't consist of "pinches" and "splashes" of things, but eventually I got pretty close.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient              | Amount                                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bacon                   | 1 lb                                                                 |
| Eggs                    | 2 per omelet                                                         |

| Shredded cheddar cheese | Enough to coat the entirety of each omelet (will differ by pan size) |
| Salt and pepper         | To taste                                                             |
| Yellow onion (optional) | 1                                                                    |
| Sausage (optional)      | To taste                                                             |

For frozen potatoes:

| Ingredient      | Amount                                                        |

For fresh potatoes:

| Ingredient    | Amount           |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Potatoes      | 1 lb per omelet  |

## Prep

### Bacon

1. Cook bacon
1. Break up into small pieces

You can either fry or bake the bacon, depending on your preference. Below are instructions for baking the bacon:

1. Meanwhile, get out another cookie sheet and cover it with tinfoil
1. <span>Place the uncooked strips of bacon on a [steel baking rack][amazon-baking-rack]</span>
   - If you don't have a baking rack...you should get one, it's wonderful
1. Put the rack on your tinfoil covered cookie sheet, and cook for 28 minutes, or until desired crispiness. But I'm telling you, 28 minutes is the sweet spot
1. Once cooked to perfection, break up the bacon into small pieces

### Potatoes

For the potatoes, you have the option of frying fresh potatoes or simply cooking and using frozen potatoes. I prefer the former because it makes the recipe soooo much simpler. But mom has always used the former.

### For fresh potatoes

1. Peel potatoes
1. Dice into small cubes (or you know, rectangular prisms).
1. Pour vegetable oil into a large frying pan until it's filled to a bit under a quarter of its depth.
   - Too much oil can cause it to overflow when potatoes are added because of the large amount of sizzle
1. Heat on high until potatoes sizzle when placed in.
   - Oil should be hot enough so that the outside gets crispy while the inside does not; an 8/10 usually works well
1. Using a slotted spoon, carefully place spoonfuls of potato cubes into the oil.
   - Cook the potatoes in several batches, being sure that no batch is so large that the oil threatens to bubble over
   - If at any time grease starts to overflow the pan, immediately remove it from heat
1. Let sit for two minutes (stir too early and the potatoes will turn to mush).
1. Stir until potato cuboids are golden brown.
1. Place the potatoes in a large bowl lined with paper towel to soak up grease

### Eggs

For each omelet, whisk together in a small mixing bowl:

1. 2 eggs
1. 1/8 cup of milk
1. Salt and pepper to taste

## Make It

1. Heat a small amount of olive oil (or optionally the siphoned bacon grease) over medium heat
1. Quickly pour the egg mixture into the pan to fill the bottom so that part of it doesn't start to cook before the rest
1. Let the egg solidify while filling any holes
1. Add cheese over the entirety of the egg
1. Add the remaining ingredients onto only half of the egg circle
1. When the egg has some brown on the bottom, carefully flip the other half of egg on top of the half with the ingredients - it may be easiest to use two spatulas
