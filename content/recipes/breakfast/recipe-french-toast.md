[Original Recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/7016/french-toast-i/)

Back in 711, this stuff was a Sunday of finals week tradition.

## Ingredients

| Ingredients              | Amount   |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Egg Twist Bread          | 6 slices |
| Eggs                     | 2        |
| Milk                     | ⅔ cup    |
| Ground cinnamon          | ¼ tsp    |
| Vanilla Extract          | 1 tsp    |
| Salt                     | To taste |
| Ground nutmeg (optional) | ¼ tsp    |

## Make It

1. Beat together everything, except for the bread.
1. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium heat.
1. Dunk each slice of break in egg concoction, soaking both sides.
1. Cook the bread until both sides are golden. - Optionally, you could cover the bread while it's frying to cook the insides more. - This is most beneficial if the bread is very soggy after being removed from the egg mixture.
1. Serve hot!
