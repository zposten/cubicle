## Prep

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees
1. Place the potatoes on a cookie sheet and in the oven for an hour

### Bacon

You can either fry or bake the bacon, depending on your preference. Below are instructions for baking the bacon:

1. Meanwhile, get out another cookie sheet and cover it with tinfoil
1. <span>Place the uncooked strips of bacon on a [steel baking rack][amazon-baking-rack]</span>
   - If you don't have a baking rack...you should get one, it's wonderful
1. Put the rack on your tinfoil covered cookie sheet, and cook for 28 minutes, or until desired crispiness. But I'm telling you, 28 minutes is the sweet spot
1. Once cooked to perfection, break up the bacon into small pieces

### Potatoes

1. When the potatoes are done, allow them to cool for 10 minutes
1. You can tell that they're done by sticking a fork into the center of them. If the fork goes in easily, then it's done. If not, leave them in for a few more minutes.
1. Slice the potatoes in half lengthwise
1. Scoop the flesh..no that word is too creepy. Let's use guts. Scoop the potato guts into a large bowl, leaving about a quarter inch of guts so that the skin maintains its shape. Don't throw away the skins!
1. To the potato guts, add the sour cream, butter, salt, pepper, half the onions, and half the cheese
1. Add 1/4 cup of the milk
1. Mix with a hand mixer, slowly adding the other 1/4 cup of milk if needed. Mix it until the guts are creamy and well combined with the other ingredients
1. Spoon the gut-mixture back into the potato skins
1. Top each potato with the remaining cheese, onions, and OF COURSE the bacon!
1. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees and put the potatoes back in for 15 more minutes
