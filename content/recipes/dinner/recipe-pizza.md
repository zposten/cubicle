It's hard to believe that this guy can cook, but after you try his pizza, there is no longer any denying.

This recipe makes enough for a 16 inch pizza. If you're trying to make a smaller 13 inch pizza, use about ⅔ of the dough.

## Ingredients

#### Dough

| Ingredients      | Amount    |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Warm Water       | 1 cup     |
| Cooking oil      | 2 tbsp    |
| Active dry yeast | 1 package |
| Garlic Powder    | 1 tsp     |
| Parsley          | 1 tsp     |
| Flour            | ~2¾ cups  |

#### Sauce

| Ingredients                 | Amount       |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Tomato paste                | 1 can (6 oz) |
| Italian seasoning           | 1 tsp        |
| Garlic salt                 | ½ tsp        |
| Dried red pepper (optional) | ¼ tsp        |
| Basil (optional)            | ½ tsp        |

#### Toppings

| Ingredients                   | Amount         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Bulk Italian Sausage          | ½ lb           |
| Sliced pepperoni              | To cover pizza |
| Ground pork (optional)        | To cover pizza |
| Ground beef (optional)        | To cover pizza |
| Shredded mozzarella cheese    | 2-3 cups       |
| Sliced green onion (optional) | ½ cup          |
| Black Olives (optional)       | ½ cup          |
| Mushrooms (optional)          | 1 cup          |

## Preparation

#### Dough

1. Combine all dough ingredients apart from the flour in a large mixing bowl.
1. Stir in the flour 1 cup at a time
1. Once 2.5 cups have been added, start to knead the dough with your hands.
1. Dust the dough as needed with additional flour as it becomes sticky.
1. Knead the dough until it becomes "springy" and "just a tad sticky".
1. Cover the mixing bowl to avoid debris before letting it sit for 30 minutes to rise.

#### Sauce

1. Combine all sauce ingredients in a small mixing bowl

   - Be careful on how much of the red pepper you add, it can get quite spicy.

## Make It

1. Cook and drain the Italian sausage and the beef and pork if you so choose to include them.
   - The Italian sausage cooks a lot like hamburger
1. Cover the pizza stone with wax paper
   - The wax paper is useful so that the dough is not pressed into the pizza stone, making removing it later difficult.
1. Press the dough into a circle to cover the stone
1. Flip the dough over directly onto the stone, thereby removing the wax paper.
1. Pinch/roll over the outer edge of the dough to form a crust
1. Spread the sauce over the dough with a spatula, it should be a pretty thin layer.
1. Add toppings
1. Add Cheese
1. Insert the pizza and stone into the oven
1. Bake at 375 to 425 for 15-25 min, or until cheese has browned some and crust has become crispy.

# DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GRILL THIS PIZZA

<sup>At least one pizza stone has been tragically lost to this seemingly great idea already.</sup>
