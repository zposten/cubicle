### Roast

[Original Recipe](https://amindfullmom.com/instant-pot-pot-roast/)

| Ingredient                         | Amount                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Chuck Roast                        | 3 lb                           |
| Olive Oil                          | <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tbsp |
| Salt                               | 1tsp                           |
| Pepper                             | 1tsp                           |
| Onion Powder                       | 1 tsp                          |
| Garlic, minced                     | 1 tbsp                         |
| Prepared horseradish (in a bottle) | <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup  |
| Beef stock                         | 4 cups                         |
| Carrots                            | 1lb                            |

1. Season the roast liberally with salt and pepper
1. Turn the pressure cooker to saute. Once hot, add in the oil. Sear meat on all sides, 3-4 minutes per side. Remove meat from inner pot
1. Pour in beef broth and scrape up any blackened bits on bottom of instant pot
1. Add the roast back into Instant Pot, along with the onion powder, garlic and horseradish
1. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes per pound, minus 20 minutes
   - So for a 3lb roast that would be `3 * 20 - 20 = 40 minutes`
1. When the cook time has elapsed, allow for pressure to release for 10 minutes
1. Add in the carrots and pressure cook for the final 20 minutes
1. When time has again elapsed, allow the pressure to release for 10-20 minutes

### Potatoes

When serving the perfect pot roast, you need some kind of potato. My preferred method is to serve it with my [perfect mashed potatoes](https://www.posten.io/blog/food/sides/mashed-potatoes). But if you're feeling lazy, you can just stick a pound of quartered (or mini) potatoes into the Instant Pot at the same time you add the carrots.
