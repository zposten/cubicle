## Preparation

1. <span>Coat the bottom and sides of a 9x13 cooking pan with an <i>extremely</i> generous amount of butter, even leaving small chunks of butter sitting in the pan</span>
1. Leaving a small gutter around the edge, lay chicken in the pan, starting with the corners.
   - <b>Do not pick up pieces of chicken once they have been placed</b>
1. Coat the entire top of the pans contents with the three soups beginning with the mushroom, then celery, and finally the chicken on top
1. Sprinkle both packets of Lipton Onion Soup over the contents of the pan
1. Cover with a double layer of foil

## Cooking

1. Bake for 3 hours at 325 degrees
1. When the chicken is almost done, cook the rice on the stove top
1. Serve the rice and chicken separately, but it tastes best if you shred the chicken and stir it into the rice on your plate!
